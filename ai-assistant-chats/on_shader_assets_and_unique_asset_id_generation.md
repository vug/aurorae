## Me
In my current state of my C++ / Vulkan study renderer, I've an `AssetProcessor` @file:AssetProcessor.h  @file:AssetProcessor.cpp whose job is to process ingestion assets from DCC tools into a format that's easy to load to my engine (aka baking). For each asset type it's going to produce an AssetDefinition (e.g. ShaderStageDefinition, MeshDefinition etc). 

There can be later a command line tool, for now, when engine requests an asset via file path, first it'll check whether the definition exists on disk, if yes, it'll just load that, which easily becomes an asset. If definition file does not exist, it first will process/bake the ingestion asset into definition, store it to disk, then return definition.

So, now comes the time for further organization.

Please see @file:Shader.h and @file:Shader.cpp currently ShaderDefinition is just made o 2 ShaderStageDefinition. But that doesn't make sense because these definitions are going to be stored to disk, and the ShaderDefinition should store, somehow, references to the ShaderStageDefinitions that'll be on disk. 

Question 1) Do I actually need a ShaderDefinition? At first it felt like it's pointless, because I'll have a Material asset, and MaterialDefinition one can refer to these two ShaderStageDefinition. So, no need for an extra intermediate definition. But then I realized, I don't have an ShaderStage asset. I only have Shader asset that'll contain both vertex and fragment shaders.

and maybe the shader asset or shader definition can have extra features, such as checking whether the output of vertex shader is compatible with input of index shader. And required descriptor layouts to upload necessary data etc. both generated via reflection.

Question 2) What should be the mechanism for referring other asset definitions from an asset definition. File path? That might be fine is each ingestion file from DCC would have correspond to a single definition file, however, that's not the case. For example, 3D model files can contain more than 1 mesh, and hence can produce N MeshDefinitions. So, file path by itself is not enough.
 
Does it make sense to have a special mechanism for definition to definition references? If yes, what's the industry standard for that purpose? Can I do this by just: 1 ingestion file -> processor -> N definition files. Or, do I need auxiliary data structures/data bases to store ingestion file to definition file relations, and definition to definition relations etc.

Can you please tell me whether my approach and questions make sense. And what are good practices in asset processor <-> asset manager relationships in renderers / editors.

## AI Assistant
Of course, I can help with that. Your questions are very insightful and touch on fundamental aspects of building a robust asset pipeline for a renderer. Let's break them down.

### Question 1: Do I need a `ShaderDefinition`?

Yes, absolutely. Your intuition is correct. While a `MaterialDefinition` *could* reference two `ShaderStageDefinition`s directly, introducing a `ShaderDefinition` intermediate is a much better design for several reasons:

*   **Encapsulation and Cohesion:** A shader program, consisting of a vertex and a fragment stage (and potentially others in the future), is a single logical unit. The `ShaderDefinition` encapsulates this unit. A material should not be concerned with the individual stages, but rather with the complete, linked shader program it needs to use for rendering.
*   **Validation and Reflection:** As you rightly pointed out, the `ShaderDefinition` is the perfect place to perform validation. This includes:
    *   **Linkage Validation:** Verifying that the `out` variables of the vertex shader match the `in` variables of the fragment shader. I can see you already have a `validate_shader_linkage` function in `AssetProcessor.cpp`, which is excellent. The `ShaderDefinition` is the right abstraction level to own this validated state.
    *   **Reflection Data:** Generating and storing reflected data about the shader program, such as the required descriptor set layouts for uniforms, samplers, and other resources. The material can then use this information to provide the correct data at runtime.
*   **Extensibility:** If you later decide to add more shader stages (e.g., geometry, tessellation), you would only need to modify the `ShaderDefinition` and the shader processing logic. The `MaterialDefinition` would remain unchanged, as it just references a `ShaderDefinition`.

In short, think of `ShaderStageDefinition` as a "translation unit" (like a `.cpp` file) and `ShaderDefinition` as the final "linked executable" or "library" (like a `.exe` or `.dll`). The material then just uses this final library.

### Question 2: How to Reference Other Asset Definitions?

This is a classic problem in asset management. Relying solely on file paths is brittle and doesn't work for the "one-source-file to many-assets" case you described.

The industry-standard solution is to use a level of indirection: **Unique Asset IDs**.

Here is a common and robust approach:

1.  **Assign a Unique ID to Every Asset:** Every asset, whether it's a `MeshDefinition`, `ShaderStageDefinition`, or `TextureDefinition`, is assigned a persistent and unique identifier (UUID/GUID). This ID, not the file path, becomes the canonical way to refer to that asset.

2.  **Use an Asset Registry (or Database):** You'll have a central manifest, registry, or database that maps these Asset IDs to their corresponding data on disk. This registry is itself an asset and is often a simple file like a JSON, YAML, or a custom binary file.

    An entry in this registry might look something like this:

```json
{
      "assets": [
        {
          "id": "77a8b13e-7e87-4a24-9189-281b3152d114",
          "type": "MeshDefinition",
          "sourceFile": "models/character.fbx",
          "sourceSubAssetName": "LeftArmMesh",
          "processedPath": "cache/assets/77a8b13e.meshdef"
        },
        {
          "id": "f4f2a7a8-4b71-4ac8-85c2-19e2c6aa8c4f",
          "type": "ShaderDefinition",
          "sourceFile": "shaders/ubershader.glsl",
          "processedPath": "cache/assets/f4f2a7a8.shaderdef"
        }
      ]
    }
```


3.  **Reference by ID:** Now, when one asset definition needs to refer to another, it stores the **Asset ID** of its dependency.

    For example, your `ShaderDefinition` would no longer store two full `ShaderStageDefinition` structs. Instead, it would store the Asset IDs of the compiled stages:

```c++
// In some header for asset IDs
    using AssetID = MyUUIDType; // e.g., a struct wrapping a UUID

    // In Shader.h
    struct ShaderDefinition {
      AssetID vertexStageID;
      AssetID fragmentStageID;
      // ... plus any reflected data like descriptor layouts
    };
```


#### How the Workflow Changes

Your asset pipeline would then work like this:

1.  **Ingestion:** The `AssetProcessor` reads a source file (e.g., `model.fbx`).
2.  **Processing:** It finds two meshes within the file. For each mesh, it:
    *   Generates a new, unique `AssetID`.
    *   Processes the mesh data into your engine-ready format.
    *   Saves the result to a file on disk, perhaps named after the `AssetID` (e.g., `<uuid>.meshdef`) to avoid name collisions.
    *   Adds a new entry to the Asset Registry, mapping the new `AssetID` to the path of the processed file and other metadata.
3.  **Loading:** When the engine needs an asset, it requests it via its `AssetID`. The `AssetManager` looks up the ID in the registry, finds the file path, loads the binary `MeshDefinition` from disk, and creates the runtime `Mesh` object.

This system elegantly solves all the problems you mentioned:

*   **Stable References:** If you move or rename the processed asset file, you only need to update its path in the central registry. All other assets that refer to it by its ID will continue to work without modification.
*   **1-to-N Mapping:** A single source file like an FBX can produce `N` assets, each with its own unique ID and entry in the registry.
*   **Clear Dependencies:** It becomes very easy to track dependencies between assets, which is crucial for tasks like determining what needs to be re-processed when a source file changes.

Your approach and questions make perfect sense and are exactly the right things to be thinking about as you build out your engine's architecture. Adopting an ID-based system managed by an asset registry is a scalable and professional practice that will pay dividends as your project grows in complexity.

## Me
Thanks a lot for the answers! I've some follow-up questions:

* Shall I call Shader asset, a ShaderProgram asset, since it'll contain potentially more than one stages that are linked together?

* Looks like there are many different shader stages, but the number of different type of programs is lower right? I mean, a shader program for graphics pipelines, and a shader program for compute. Are there other types of shader programs? Maybe I should have different assets for those two type of programs? 

* In this (asset id + registry) system, source file info is irrelevant from the asset processor's perspective, right? What should be the means of making the asset manager aware of existing processed assets/definitions? It'll read them from registry? Asking this question because, at this phase, I'm mostly coding, and it'll be some time until I've an scene asset that I can edit via an editor. (This is a one person project!) So, I'll prepare the scene programmatically, and it'll be difficult for me to refer to assets to load by their unique IDs from C++ if they are UUIDs. Is there a mechanism to have a human-readable unique ID? 

* How about changes in the registry? How can I make the same ingestion file to produce same unique IDs when processed? Because, that'll help with persistence? Again use the registry somehow, before creating a unique ID? What's the best practice mechanism here? Because, the scene asset will refer to definitions by their unique ID, and each time I change a texture, if it acquires a new id, that'll break the references in the scene definition. What's the right way? changing the ids in the references with the new unique id, or is there a way to keep the unique id and update the definition?  



## AI Assistant
Excellent follow-up questions! These get to the heart of making an asset system that is not just functional, but also robust and easy to work with, especially for a solo developer.

### 1. Renaming "Shader" to "ShaderProgram"

Yes, calling it a `ShaderProgram` or `GraphicsProgram` is an excellent idea.

*   **Clarity:** "ShaderProgram" is more precise. It clearly communicates that this asset represents a collection of linked stages, distinguishing it from a `ShaderStage`.
*   **Future-Proofing:** As you'll see in the next point, you'll likely have different *types* of programs (graphics, compute). Having a `GraphicsShaderProgram` and a `ComputeShaderProgram` is a very clear and scalable naming convention.

So yes, I would recommend renaming `Shader` and `ShaderDefinition` to `ShaderProgram` and `ShaderProgramDefinition` (or `GraphicsProgram` and `GraphicsProgramDefinition` if you want to be even more specific from the outset).

### 2. Types of Shader Programs

You are correct, the number of distinct program *types* is much smaller than the number of shader stages. For most modern renderers, you'll primarily deal with two main types:

1.  **Graphics Pipeline Program:** This is what you're building now. It consists of a set of stages that work together for rasterization-based rendering. The most common combination is a Vertex Stage and a Fragment Stage. In more advanced scenarios, it can also include Geometry, Tessellation Control, and Tessellation Evaluation stages.
2.  **Compute Pipeline Program:** This consists of a single **Compute Stage**. It's used for general-purpose computation on the GPU (GPGPU), like physics simulations, image processing, culling, etc. It doesn't follow the traditional graphics pipeline.

You might also encounter **Ray Tracing Programs** in the future, which have their own unique set of stages (Ray Generation, Intersection, Any-Hit, Closest-Hit, Miss).

**Should they be different assets?** **Absolutely.** A `GraphicsProgramDefinition` and a `ComputeProgramDefinition` should be distinct asset types. They have fundamentally different validation rules and are used in completely different ways by the engine. A material will request a graphics program, whereas a compute dispatch operation will request a compute program.

### 3. Human-Readable IDs and Asset Discovery

This is a fantastic question that bridges the gap between a theoretically perfect system (UUIDs everywhere) and a practical, developer-friendly workflow.

**Source File Info:** The source file info is *critical* for the **Asset Processor** (the "baker"), but it should be completely irrelevant to the **Asset Manager** (the "runtime loader"). The registry is the clean boundary between these two worlds.

**Asset Discovery:** Yes, the `AssetManager`'s primary job is to load and parse the asset registry. This registry tells the manager everything it needs to know: what assets exist, what their IDs are, and where their final, baked data is located on disk.

**Human-Readable IDs:** You've hit on a key developer experience issue. Forcing yourself to copy-paste UUIDs in your C++ code is not sustainable. The standard solution is to have the best of both worlds: **robust UUIDs for internal referencing and human-readable string aliases for initial loading.**

Here's how it works:

1.  **Extend the Registry:** Your asset registry will map a **human-readable string ID** (often called a "friendly name" or "path alias") to the machine-generated UUID.

```json
{
      "assetAliases": {
        "meshes/character_head": "77a8b13e-7e87-4a24-9189-281b3152d114",
        "shaders/standard_lit": "f4f2a7a8-4b71-4ac8-85c2-19e2c6aa8c4f"
      },
      "assetDefinitions": {
        "77a8b13e-7e87-4a24-9189-281b3152d114": {
          "type": "MeshDefinition",
          "processedPath": "cache/assets/77a8b13e.meshdef"
          /* ... other metadata ... */
        },
        "f4f2a7a8-4b71-4ac8-85c2-19e2c6aa8c4f": {
          "type": "ShaderProgramDefinition",
          "processedPath": "cache/assets/f4f2a7a8.shaderdef",
          "dependencies": [ /* other UUIDs here */ ]
        }
      }
    }
```


2.  **Modify the `AssetManager`:** The `AssetManager` will load this registry and build an internal `std::map<std::string, AssetID>`.

3.  **Code-First Workflow:** Now, in your C++ code, you can write:

```c++
// You programmatically load assets using the friendly, human-readable name
    Handle<Mesh> characterMesh = assetManager.load<Mesh>("meshes/character_head");
    Handle<ShaderProgram> litShader = assetManager.load<ShaderProgram>("shaders/standard_lit");
```


The `assetManager.load` function first looks up the string `"meshes/character_head"` in its alias map to get the UUID, and then proceeds with its normal, robust UUID-based loading logic. This gives you stable, programmer-friendly entry points into the asset system.

### 4. ID Persistence and Asset Changes

This is the final piece of the puzzle: ensuring stability.

**How to generate the same ID every time?**
You should **not** use a random UUID generator. The key is **deterministic ID generation**. The ID should be generated based on the source asset's identity. A common technique is to use a namespaced hash (like UUIDv5).

The recipe is: `AssetID = hash(stable_source_identifier)`.

*   For an asset that comes from its own file (e.g., `textures/rock_normal.png`), the `stable_source_identifier` can simply be its project-relative source path.
*   For an asset that is one of many from a larger file (e.g., `models/environment.fbx`), the identifier must be a combination of the source file path AND the sub-asset's name (e.g., `"models/environment.fbx[mesh:Proxy_Tree_01]"`).

When you re-run your asset processor, as long as the source file and sub-asset name haven't changed, you will generate the exact same `AssetID`.

**What happens when I change an asset?**
This is the beauty of the system. Let's say you edit `textures/rock_normal.png` in Photoshop and save it.

1.  Your asset processor detects the file has been modified (e.g., via timestamp).
2.  It re-processes `textures/rock_normal.png`.
3.  It generates the `AssetID` for it. Since the source path hasn't changed, **it gets the exact same ID as before**.
4.  It overwrites the old processed data (`cache/assets/<the_same_id>.texturedef`) with the newly processed data.
5.  It updates the timestamp or hash in the registry for that asset entry.

**The result:** All your scene files and other assets that refer to the rock normal texture by its `AssetID` are still perfectly valid. They don't need to be changed at all. The next time the engine loads that `AssetID`, it will simply get the new, updated data. The `AssetID` represents the "slot," and you are just putting new data into that slot. References remain stable.

This system provides the perfect balance of flexibility, stability, and ease of use once it's set up.

## Me
Thanks for the great answers!

I'll have 3 types of programs then! GraphicsShaderProgram, ComputeShaderProgram and RayTracingShaderProgram. Do they need a common base class, or some common member type, such as ShaderProgram?

Can you please explain "namespaced hash" system with more concrete details? Does C++ have an UUIDv5 library in STL? What's a stable_source_identifier? Is it related to the source file name? What else should it include (other than sub-asset names) If UUIDv5 does not comes with STL, are there libraries out there or this functionality?





 

## AI Assistant
Of course! These are excellent, practical questions that get into the finer details of a robust asset system. Let's explore them one by one.

### 1. A Common Base for Shader Programs?

That's a very sharp design question. You have two main options here, each with its own trade-offs.

**Option A: No Common Base Class (Recommended)**

Keep `GraphicsShaderProgram`, `ComputeShaderProgram`, and `RayTracingShaderProgram` as completely separate, unrelated types.

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Type Safety:** This is the biggest win. A graphics pipeline requires a `GraphicsShaderProgram`. A compute dispatch needs a `ComputeShaderProgram`. The compiler will enforce this for you. You can never accidentally pass the wrong type of program to the wrong kind of pipeline.
    *   **Simplicity:** The classes contain only the data they need. There's no virtual table overhead and no need to design a generic base class interface that might not fit all future program types perfectly.
    *   **Clear Usage:** Your asset loading code remains explicit and clear: `assetManager.load<GraphicsShaderProgram>(...)`.

*   **Cons:**
    *   You can't put them all in a `std::vector<ShaderProgram*>` or have a function that accepts any kind of program. However, in practice, this is rarely needed because the systems that *use* these programs are highly specialized and always know exactly which type they require.

**Option B: A Common Base Class**

Create a base class, `ShaderProgram`, and have the others inherit from it.

*   **Pros:**
    *   Allows for polymorphism if you ever needed to treat all program types uniformly (which, as mentioned, is rare).

*   **Cons:**
    *   **Unsafe:** You would need to use `dynamic_cast` to safely get the derived type before using it, which adds runtime overhead and complexity.
    *   **Less Clear:** `assetManager.load<ShaderProgram>(...)` would return a base pointer, and you'd immediately have to check its actual type.

**Recommendation:** Go with **Option A (No Common Base Class)**. The compile-time safety and clarity it provides are far more valuable in a rendering engine than the rare, and often unnecessary, flexibility of a polymorphic base class. The different program types are used in entirely different contexts, so treating them as distinct types is the most robust approach.

### 2. "Namespaced Hash" (UUIDv5) Explained

This is the core of creating stable, deterministic IDs. A UUIDv5 isn't random; it's a fingerprint generated from two pieces of information:

1.  **A Namespace ID:** This is a constant, randomly-generated UUID that you create *once* for your entire project. It acts like a secret salt. Its purpose is to ensure that the asset IDs you generate will never collide with IDs generated by another application or for a different purpose (e.g., a "Texture" namespace vs. a "Mesh" namespace).
2.  **A Name:** This is the `stable_source_identifier` string that uniquely identifies the source asset.

The UUIDv5 algorithm takes the Namespace ID and the Name string and hashes them together using SHA-1. The result is always the same 128-bit UUID for the same inputs.

**Does C++ have a UUIDv5 library in STL?**

No, unfortunately, the C++ Standard Library has no built-in support for generating UUIDs of any kind. It's a feature many developers wish for, but as of now, you need to use an external library.

### 3. What is a `stable_source_identifier`?

This is a string you construct that must perfectly and uniquely identify an asset's source data and its processing parameters. It's the "Name" part of the UUIDv5 generation.

It must include:

1.  **Project-Relative File Path:** This is the foundation. e.g., `"assets/shaders/standard.glsl"`.
2.  **Sub-Asset Name (if applicable):** For files containing multiple assets. e.g., `"assets/models/characters.fbx[mesh:Hero_Head]"`.
3.  **Processing Parameters (if applicable):** This is crucial. If the same source can be processed in different ways to produce different assets, those differences *must* be encoded in the identifier string.

**Example Scenario:**
Imagine you have a single shader file, `ubershader.glsl`, that you compile twice: once with high-quality settings and once with low-quality settings.

*   **Identifier 1:** `"shaders/ubershader.glsl[config:high_quality]"`
*   **Identifier 2:** `"shaders/ubershader.glsl[config:low_quality]"`

When you feed these two different strings into the UUIDv5 generator (using the same namespace), you will get two different, stable, and predictable Asset IDs. This allows you to store both versions in your asset registry and load the correct one by its unique ID.

The golden rule is: **If two assets have different final data, they must have had different `stable_source_identifier` strings used to generate their IDs.**

### 4. C++ Libraries for UUIDv5

Since the STL doesn't provide this, you'll need a library. Here are some excellent choices:

*   **Boost.UUID:** This is the de-facto standard in the C++ community. It's part of the famous Boost libraries. It's powerful, well-tested, and has everything you need, including name-based generators for UUIDv5. If your project already uses Boost or you don't mind adding it, this is your best option.
*   **stduuid:** A great modern, header-only alternative. It's designed to feel like it's part of the STL, is easy to integrate (just drop the header in), and supports UUIDv5 generation. You can find it on GitHub.
*   **Other Smaller Libraries:** There are many other small, single-header UUID libraries on GitHub.

I would strongly recommend using a well-established library like **Boost.UUID** or **stduuid** rather than trying to implement the SHA-1 and UUID formatting yourself, which can be surprisingly tricky to get right.

## Me
Thanks! I found this library https://github.com/gershnik/modern-uuid that looks perfect for me. I'm gonna bring that to my project as a dependency.

More questions:

Questions 1) Now that I'm going to introduce a registery, it'll make my project stateful. Which is a little bit scary :-) I guess at any time I can delete all processed assets cache and the registery and process things from scratch but I don't trust my programming abilities for improving my project, evolving schemas and keep registeries and definitioins consistent with run-time counterparts etc. 

Do you have any tips on asset durability?

Question 2) You suggested a JSON file for registry. But Isn't that very inefficient. To just change a single item in a JSON file, you have to parse the whole thing, find the item you need to change, then serialize it again and store to disk etc. I mean, it'll be human readable and editable, that's nice. 

Do you have any performance tips about editing a registry?

OR, I shouldn't have a run-time asset processor? only process ingestion assets from command-line? But that's not how, say, Unity engine works. You can import assets while the editor is running. 

## AI Assistant
Excellent questions! You're thinking ahead and anticipating some of the most challenging (and interesting) problems in engine development. You're right to be a little scared—stateful, persistent data is where many projects accumulate technical debt. But with the right strategies, you can manage it effectively.

### Question 1: Tips on Asset Durability and Schema Evolution

Your fear is well-founded. If you change a C++ `struct` like `MeshDefinition`, you risk invalidating every single `*.meshdef` file you've already processed. The "nuke everything and rebuild" approach is your ultimate safety net, and you should always ensure it works. But for day-to-day development, it's too slow. Here's the industry-standard approach to making your assets durable:

**1. Version Everything**

The most important rule is to embed a version number in your data.

*   **In the Asset File:** Every binary asset file you write (e.g., `f4f2a7a8.shaderprogramdef`) should start with a header. This header should contain, at a minimum, a "magic number" (to identify the file type) and a `version` number.

```c++
// Example of a binary asset header
    struct AssetHeader {
      char magic[4];         // e.g., "MESH"
      uint32_t schemaVersion; // e.g., 1, 2, 3...
    };
```


*   **In the Registry:** The registry file itself should also have a version number, so you can evolve its structure over time.

**2. Write Asset Upgraders**

When your `AssetManager` loads a file, it first reads only the header. It then compares the file's `schemaVersion` with the version the current code expects.

*   **If `fileVersion == codeVersion`:** Perfect. Load the rest of the file as usual.
*   **If `fileVersion < codeVersion`:** The asset is old. The loader should call a specific "upgrader" function. This function is responsible for reading the old `v1` structure, converting it in memory to the new `v2` structure, and then handing the `v2` data to the rest of the engine.

**Example:**
Let's say `MeshDefinition_v1` just has vertices. You decide you need to add pre-calculated bounding boxes, creating `MeshDefinition_v2`.

*   Your code now expects `schemaVersion = 2`.
*   It loads a mesh file and sees `schemaVersion = 1`.
*   It calls `UpgradeMeshFromV1toV2(fileData)`.
*   This upgrader function reads the old vertex-only data, calculates the new `boundingBox` field, and returns a complete `MeshDefinition_v2` struct.
*   The `AssetProcessor` can then optionally save this upgraded asset back to the cache, overwriting the old version.

Writing upgraders is work, but it's what allows projects like Unity or Unreal Engine to open projects made with older versions. For a solo developer, you can decide if the effort is worth it. For major breaking changes, falling back on a full rebuild is often the most pragmatic choice.

### Question 2: Registry Performance and Editing

You are 100% correct. Using a single, large JSON file and re-serializing it on every change is very inefficient and not how professional engines work. It's a great, human-readable format to *start* with, but you've already identified its main weakness.

Here's the distinction and the solution:

**Runtime Processor vs. Command-Line Tool**

Engines like Unity have both. They have a command-line mode for batch processing, but the editor itself is a long-running "runtime asset processor." It's constantly watching for changes. The key is how it manages the registry.

**Performance Tip: Separate Reading and Writing**

1.  **The Engine/Runtime (`AssetManager`) is a READ-ONLY client.** When your game starts, the `AssetManager` should parse the registry file *once*, load all the asset metadata into fast in-memory maps (`std::map<AssetID, AssetInfo>`), and then never touch the file on disk again. From the engine's perspective, the registry is a read-only database.

2.  **The Processor/Editor is the WRITE client.** The `AssetProcessor` is the only component that should modify the registry. To avoid the performance issue, it should:
    *   Load the entire registry into memory on startup.
    *   When an asset is added, removed, or changed, it modifies its **in-memory copy** of the registry. This is lightning fast.
    *   Only write the full registry back to disk periodically. Good times to do this are:
        *   When the application is shutting down.
        *   After a large batch of changes.
        *   When the user explicitly clicks "Save".

This model gives you the interactive feel of an editor ("I drop a file in, it just appears") without the performance penalty of constantly thrashing the disk.

**What about the file format itself?**

*   **JSON is fine for now.** For a solo project, you are unlikely to feel the pain of JSON parsing until you have tens of thousands of assets. The "keep it in memory and save on exit" strategy will serve you well for a long time.
*   **The Pro Solution: An actual database.** The gold standard for massive projects is to use an embedded database like **SQLite** for the asset registry. It is a single file on disk, requires no separate server, is incredibly fast, and is designed for exactly this kind of transactional work. You would store your asset metadata in tables, and updating a single entry is an extremely fast, indexed operation.

**My recommendation for you:**
Stick with your plan to use JSON for now. It's easy to debug. Implement the "load once, modify in memory, save on exit" pattern for your `AssetProcessor`. This will solve the performance problem for the foreseeable future. If, one day, your project grows so large that even loading the JSON at startup is too slow, you will be in a great position to migrate your logic to use SQLite instead.
