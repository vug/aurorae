User: 
In the selected lines, after calculating my projection matrix, I multiple the  [1][1] element of it with -1 to get the resul in left-handed coordinate system because Vulkan uses it.

Is that right that Vulkan uses left-handed coordinate system? (Does OpenGL uses right-handed?) Is flipping [1][1] is the right way of doing the coordinate system conversion? Is there a better way to do it? Does GLM provide functionality to set the handed-ness globally?

==== Message #2 ====
Assistant: 
Regarding coordinate systems in Vulkan and OpenGL:

1.  **Vulkan's Coordinate System Handedness:** This is a point of frequent confusion. While Vulkan's **clip space** (Normalized Device Coordinates - NDC) is often described as having a **right-handed** orientation with its Y-axis pointing **downwards** and its Z-axis typically ranging from 0 to 1 (for depth), it's important to understand this in context. The primary difference from traditional OpenGL is the Y-axis direction and the Z-depth range.
    *   Many sources, including Khronos documentation, indicate that Vulkan's NDC Y-axis points down [[1]](https://community.khronos.org/t/about-coordinate-system/111278), [[3]](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/publications/2022/fiedler-2022-vlk/fiedler-2022-vlk-Primer%20on%20Coordinate%20Systems.pdf).
    *   Some refer to Vulkan as explicitly requiring a right-handed NDC space [[5]](https://anki3d.org/vulkan-coordinate-system/), [[6]](https://www.khronos.org/news/permalink/handling-differences-between-vulkan-and-opengl-coordinate-system), [[7]](https://johannesugb.github.io/gpu-programming/setting-up-a-proper-vulkan-projection-matrix/).

2.  **OpenGL's Coordinate System Handedness:** OpenGL traditionally uses a **right-handed** coordinate system for its model and view spaces. Its Normalized Device Coordinates (NDC) are also considered right-handed, with the Y-axis pointing **upwards** and the Z-axis ranging from -1 to 1.

3.  **Flipping `[1][1]` for Conversion:** Yes, multiplying the `[1][1]` element of your projection matrix by -1 is a **correct and common way** to invert the Y-axis direction in the projected coordinates. This effectively adapts a projection matrix (like one generated for OpenGL's Y-up convention) to Vulkan's Y-down convention. This is a pragmatic solution to handle the differing Y-axis directions.

4.  **Better Way and GLM Functionality:** While your current method works, GLM doesn't have a single "global handedness setting" for `glm::perspective`. Instead, you typically handle the differences through specific matrix multiplications or by choosing more appropriate GLM functions.

    Here are a few common and more explicit ways to achieve a Vulkan-compatible projection matrix with GLM, addressing the Y-flip and depth range (Vulkan typically uses a `[0, 1]` depth range instead of `[-1, 1]`):

    *   **Using a scale matrix for Y-flip:** You can post-multiply your `glm::perspective` matrix with a scale matrix that flips the Y-axis.
        ```cpp
        // For Vulkan, using glm::perspective (which defaults to OpenGL conventions)
        // and then applying a Y-flip.
        glm::mat4 projection = glm::perspective(glm::radians(45.0f), static_cast<f32>(window_.getWitdh()) / window_.getHeight(), 0.1f, 100.0f);
        projection[1][1] *= -1; // Your current method, which is valid for Y-flip.

        // More explicit Y-flip as a separate matrix (can be useful for clarity)
        // glm::mat4 vulkanClipMatrix = glm::mat4(1.0f);
        // vulkanClipMatrix[1][1] = -1.0f; // Flip Y
        // projection = vulkanClipMatrix * projection; // Pre-multiply for a left-handed system, or post-multiply for right-handed Y-flip.
                                                     // In this case, post-multiplying would also work if you're trying to
                                                     // flip the Y-axis of the result of perspective.
        ```
        A common pattern you'll see is `glm::mat4(1.0f, -1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f)` applied after `glm::perspective`.

    *   **Using GLM's `perspectiveZO` functions:** GLM offers `_ZO` (Zero to One) variants for depth range. While `glm::perspective` by default generates a matrix for OpenGL's `[-1, 1]` depth range and Y-up, you can combine this with transformations to achieve the Vulkan convention.
        *   `glm::perspectiveRH_ZO`: This function creates a right-handed perspective projection matrix with depth ranging from 0 to 1. You would still need to account for the Y-down convention if `glm::perspectiveRH_ZO` itself produces a Y-up system in its output.

    A commonly recommended approach for Vulkan with GLM is to use `glm::perspective` as you are, and then multiply the generated matrix by a matrix that flips the Y-axis and potentially maps the depth range to `[0, 1]`. For example:

    <llm-snippet-file>Application.cpp</llm-snippet-file>
    ```cpp
        // perFrame data need to be set before beginFrame().
        renderer_.perFrameData = {
            .viewFromObject = glm::lookAt(glm::vec3{-5, -5, -5}, glm::vec3{0}, glm::vec3{0, 1, 0}),
            // Use glm::perspective for the core projection
            .projectionFromView = glm::perspective(
                glm::radians(45.0f), static_cast<f32>(window_.getWitdh()) / window_.getHeight(), 0.1f, 100.0f)};
        // Apply Vulkan-specific adjustments
        // Flip Y and map Z from [-1, 1] to [0, 1] as Vulkan uses Y-down and [0, 1] depth.
        // The matrix below handles both the Y-flip and depth mapping.
        glm::mat4 vulkanClipMatrix = glm::mat4(
            1.0f,  0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f,
            0.0f, -1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, // Flip Y
            0.0f,  0.0f, 0.5f, 0.5f, // Map Z from [-1, 1] to [0, 1] (0.5*z + 0.5)
            0.0f,  0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f
        );
        renderer_.perFrameData.projectionFromView = vulkanClipMatrix * renderer_.perFrameData.projectionFromView;
    ```
    This `vulkanClipMatrix` will correctly transform the `glm::perspective` output to match Vulkan's conventions. Your current `projectionFromView[1][1] *= -1;` only handles the Y-flip, which is often sufficient if your depth handling is otherwise compatible or handled elsewhere. Using the explicit `vulkanClipMatrix` is generally considered a more robust and readable approach for full Vulkan compatibility.
